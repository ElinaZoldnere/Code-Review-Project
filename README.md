# Code Review Project  
This repository contains a project in which a simplified distributed backend system is gradually 
evolved by identifying real-world problems and exploring practical solutions.

## About the Project
The project starts from existing baseline of two simplified microservices deployed in Docker 
containers. From there, it is improved step by step, addressing scalability, reliability, 
observability and data integrity.

The expected final result is a backend system that can run reliably in a distributed environment, 
including multiple service instances, concurrent requests, and partial failures.
